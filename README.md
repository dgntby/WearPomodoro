What
----
Yet Another Android Pomodoro Client

Why
---
There are already bunch of Pomodoro Applications on the Play Store. And there are couple of Android Wear spesific apps. Most of them are even open-source. 

I personally had problems with them and wanted to write one from scratch.

What does this repo have extra?
- Demonstrates a good example of separate Android Wear app with custom embedded `Activity` in the notification.
- Code sharing between the phone part and wear part. 
- Product flavors with Android Wear. 
- Usage of Dagger 2. 
  - It is great for both the shared code between mobile and wear parts and additionally for product flavor differences. 
- [FUTURE] Colloborative Pomodoro with Google Cast support. How cool is that. :)
