Pomodoro Tracking application that seemlesly work with Android Wear.

Say <strong>"OK Google, start working"</strong> on your watch to start the application. 

<strong>What is Pomodoro?</strong>
With this technique, you basically and systematically work like the following simple flow:
<strong>1.</strong>  Decide on the task to be done
<strong>2.</strong>  Start the pomodoro timer.
<strong>3.</strong>  Work for 25 minutes on the task until the timer rings.
<strong>4.</strong>  Take a short break (5 minutes)
<strong>5.</strong>  After four pomodori, take a longer break (15 minutes)

With its beautiful Material Design with cool animations, it can help you work effectively. 

* No ads
* Beautiful design
* Simplicity

It can run on <strong>phones, tablets, watches and even Android TVs</strong>.
It can run on the watch itself offline, so you don't need your phone to be connected. However, when the phone app detects the app running on the watch, it syncs automagically. 

And guess what, it is open source:
